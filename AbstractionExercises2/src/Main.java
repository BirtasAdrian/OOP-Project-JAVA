//    1. Create Passenger class, with String property name and abstract method userBenefits()
//    Create child classes FirstClassPassenger, SecondClassPassenger and ThirdClassPassenger.
//    Add 5 passengers of each type in a list and make all of them enjoy the class benefits (champagne, peanuts,
//    space, etc)

//   2. Create abstract class Cryptocurrency, with property double valueInUSD and abstract method void changeValue()
//   Create child classes Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP, which will have their own implementation of the changeValue() method
//   Bitcoin has a 60% chance of going up by 100 dollars, and a 40% chance of going down by 80 dollars.
//   Ethereum has a 50% chance of increasing by 50 dollars, and a 50% chance of decreasing by 50 dollars.
//   XRP has an 89% chance of going up by 10 dollars, and a 20% chance of going down by 30 dollars.


//   Initialize one coin of each type, with initial value 1000, and run each method 30 times.
//   Print the final value of the coins.
